# YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesFusionList

Yes. 722 cards, 521 284 possible combinations (considering non commutativity). I wrote an AutoHotKey script and a program in Java with JNA that automatically plays the game and checks every possible fusion, and write the results to text files. Unfortunately, I blindly updated JNA and the new version doesn't work as the old one, so my program is not working anymore. I'll make a new version and then upload it here. Until then, the list that was compiled can be kept here, so the results can still be used. I left the program running overnight everyday and it took about a month to check all fusions.

Consider that every fusion is in the form X + Y = Z. The fusion list is in the following format:

<div>
  X1<br>
+ Y1<br>
= Z1<br>
+ Y2<br>
= Z2<br>
⋮<br>
----<br>
  X2<br>
+ Y1<br>
= Z3<br>
+ Y2<br>
= Z4<br>
⋮<br>
</div>
(I ought to improve the formatting here, sorry)

As I wrongly knew, knoww that it is _not_ legal to own a PlayStation's BIOS, even if you do own a PlayStation. Fortunately, there's an emulator called PCSX-Reloaded (PCSX-R) that doesn't need a BIOS, so it's perfectly legal to play emulated PlayStation games, as long as you own the games themselves.
