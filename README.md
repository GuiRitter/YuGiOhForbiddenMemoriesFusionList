# YuGiOhForbiddenMemoriesFusionList

Yes. 722 cards, 521 284 possible combinations (considering non commutativity). I wrote an AutoHotKey script and a program in Java with JNA that automatically plays the game and checks every possible fusion, and write the results to text files. Unfortunately, I blindly updated JNA and the new version doesn't work as the old one, so my program is not working anymore. I'll make a new version and then upload it here. Until then, the list that was compiled can be kept here, so the results can still be used. I left the program running overnight everyday and it took about a month to check all fusions.

Consider that every fusion is in the form X + Y = Z. The fusion list is in the following format:

```
  X1
+ Y1
= Z1
+ Y2
= Z2
⋮
----
  X2
+ Y1
= Z3
+ Y2
= Z4
⋮
```

As I wrongly knew, know that it is _not_ legal to own a PlayStation's BIOS, even if you do own a PlayStation. Fortunately, there's an emulator called PCSX-Reloaded (PCSX-R) that doesn't need a BIOS, so it's perfectly legal to play emulated PlayStation games, as long as you own the games themselves.
